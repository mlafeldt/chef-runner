The purpose of chef-runner explained in one tweet:

For more background, check out my blog post *[Telling people about
chef-runner][blog post]*.

## What is chef-runner?

* A command-line tool that speeds up your Chef development and testing workflow.
* A fast alternative to the painfully slow `vagrant provision` ([demo video]
  comparing both tools).
* Rapidly provisions local Vagrant machines as well as remote machines like EC2
  instances.
* [Integrates with Vim](#use-with-vim) so you don't have to leave your editor
  while hacking on recipes.
* Allows you to change infrastructure code and get **immediate feedback**.

## How does it work?

* Prepares Chef configuration and cookbooks in local `.chef-runner` folder.
* Installs cookbook dependencies with Berkshelf and updates changes with rsync.
* Uploads data to target machine using rsync over SSH.
* Directly executes Chef Solo over SSH.
* Overrides Chef run list to selectively run recipes.

## Requirements

To use chef-runner, you need the following software:

* `ssh` command-line tool (OpenSSH)
* `rsync` command-line tool
* [Berkshelf] - installable via `gem install berkshelf` or Bundler
* Chef must be pre-installed on the target machine

Additionally, your cookbook must have the following files:

* `metadata.rb` - must define the cookbook's name
* `Berksfile` - must define all required cookbook dependencies

When using chef-runner with [Vagrant], make sure you have Vagrant version 1.3.4
or higher.

To give you an example, the [Practicing Ruby cookbook][pr-cookbook] is known to
work well with chef-runner.

## Installation

First, make sure you have [Go] version 1.2 or higher.

This single line will download, compile, and install the `chef-runner`
command-line tool:

    $ go get github.com/mlafeldt/chef-runner

For this command to work, `$GOPATH` must be set correctly. Also check that
`$GOPATH` is part of `$PATH`, so that the `chef-runner` executable can be found.
For example, here are the relevant lines from my `~/.bashrc` file:

    export GOPATH="$HOME/devel/go"
    export GOROOT="$(go env GOROOT)"
    export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$PATH"

## Usage

### Command Line Reference

chef-runner is a simple command-line tool that has a couple of options:

    Usage: chef-runner [options] [--] [<recipe>...]

        -h              Show help text
        -H <name>       Set hostname for direct SSH access
        -M <name>       Set name of Vagrant virtual machine

    Options that will be passed to Chef Solo:

        -F <format>     Set output format (null, doc, minimal, min)
                        default: null
        -l <level>      Set log level (debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
                        default: info
        -j <file>       Load attributes from a JSON file

### Running Chef Recipes

chef-runner executes one or more recipes you pass on the command line, in the
exact order given. The tool has a flexible recipe syntax allowing you to compose
your [run list] in multiple ways.

1) Run default recipe when passing no arguments:

    $ chef-runner

2) Run local recipe when passing filename:

    $ chef-runner recipes/foo.rb

3) Run local recipe when passing recipe name:

    $ chef-runner foo

4) Run external recipe when passing `cookbook::recipe`:

    $ chef-runner dogs::bar

5) Run multiple recipes (of mixed type) in order given:

    $ chef-runner recipes/foo.rb bar dogs::baz

Moreover, chef-runner allows you to load node attributes from a JSON file (that
is located inside your cookbook):

    $ chef-runner -j chef.json

You can also configure both output format and log level of Chef:

    $ chef-runner -F doc -l warn

Last but not least, here is how to enable debug messages:

    $ CHEF_RUNNER_LOG=debug chef-runner ...

### Vagrant

Here's how to use chef-runner with local Vagrant machines:

First, make sure that the Vagrant machine you want to provision is running in
the background. You can check the status with `vagrant status`. If the machine
isn't up yet, run `vagrant up`.

If your `Vagrantfile` only defines a single machine, simply run `chef-runner`
and it should work. In a multi-machine environment, you need to specify what
Vagrant machine you want to use. Use the `-M` option to set the name of the
Vagrant machine. The machine name is the name you have defined in your
`Vagrantfile`. To get a list of all machine names, run `vagrant status`.

Example:

    $ chef-runner -M db

### SSH

chef-runner can also provision remote machines like EC2 instances, or basically
any systems reachable over SSH.

Use the `-H` option to specify the name of a host that was configured for direct
SSH access. The argument passed to `-H` has the format `[user@]hostname[:port]`,
allowing you to optionally change SSH user and port. If you need to change other
SSH settings, add a host-specific configuration section to your `~/.ssh/config`.

Examples:

    $ chef-runner -H example.local
    $ chef-runner -H user@example.local
    $ chef-runner -H example.local:1234

### Use with Vim

As a matter of fact, I primarily wrote chef-runner for use with Vim. Instead of
jumping back and forth between editing a Chef recipe and running `vagrant
provision`, I wanted to be able to change some code and get immediate feedback
without having to leave the editor. This is where chef-runner's ability to run a
single recipe file -- the file currently open in Vim -- comes in handy.

There's no Vim plugin (yet). For now, you can just stick this one-liner in your
`.vimrc`:

```vim
nnoremap <leader>r :w\|!chef-runner %<cr>
```

With this key mapping in place, make sure that the target machine is up and open
a recipe in Vim:

```sh
$ vim recipes/default.rb
```

Now whenever you type `<leader>r` (your [leader key] then `r`), chef-runner will
run the *current* recipe on the target machine, giving you fast feedback on
local code changes. (As a bonus, the mapping will also save the file for you.)

Of course, you can also change the key mapping to include whatever chef-runner
options you need. For example, I like using a Chef output format that is less
verbose:

```vim
nnoremap <leader>r :w\|!chef-runner -F min -l warn %<cr>
```

Last but not least, you can always reprogram the Vim key mapping at runtime if
you need to pass project-specific options like host or machine name:

```vim
:nnoremap <leader>r :w\|!chef-runner -F min -l warn -H example.local %<cr>
```

## More Tips

You can further speed up working with chef-runner by doing the following:

* Split up Chef recipes into smaller logical chunks and include those chunks
  using the `include_recipe` method ([good example][pr-recipes]).
* Enable [SSH connection sharing and persistence][ssh-speedup] to speed up
  repeated SSH connections.

## Testing

chef-runner comes with lots of Go unit tests that help to ensure the tool works
as expected. You can run all tests this way:

    $ ./script/test
